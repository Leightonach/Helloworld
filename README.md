Just starting out trying to learn Javascript
I am an absolute novice to the point where I had not done any coding in any language beform last week. Right now I am struggling my way through the most basic of tutorials (March 2019). I have a project in mind that I would like to work on eventually but I need to learn basic syntax first.
